This repository hosts two main components:

1. **Model Selection:**
   - Located in the `model_selection` folder, this module aids users in selecting the best machine learning model for their dataset. The provided web application supports classification tasks using various models. Note that not all classification models are included.

2. **Dark Patterns Classification:**
   - Within the `Dark_patterns` folder, a Python file is included for classifying datasets as deceptive or not. Achieving an accuracy of 93%, this model is based on a dataset collected from websites containing dark patterns.

## Model Selection Web Application

The `model_selection` folder contains a web application that facilitates the selection of classification models. Users can input their dataset in CSV format, and the application recommends the best machine learning model for their specific use case.

### Instructions:
   1. Navigate to the `model_selection` folder.
   2. Run the web application to interactively explore and select the most suitable model for your dataset.

## Dark Patterns Classification

The `Dark_patterns` folder houses a Python file dedicated to classifying datasets based on the presence of dark patterns.

### Usage:
   1. Open the `dark_patterns_classification.py` file.
   2. Provide your dataset in CSV format.
   3. Run the script to classify the dataset as deceptive or not, achieving an accuracy of 93%
